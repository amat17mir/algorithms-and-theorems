#this is a quick test but basically what im doing is making a sample code file
#that somebody might see on ur github

#this was my factorial code:

def factorial(n): 
       
    if n == 0: 
        return 1
      
    return n * factorial(n-1) 
   
num = 5; 
print(num, “factorial is", factorial(num))
